This project focuses on the development of an interactive and dynamic e-commerce web page, designed to facilitate online buying and selling of specific products. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that enhances the shopping experience for users, while also serving as a learning resource for students interested in web development.

The web page will be built using various languages, including JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and CSS for styling. Additionally, SQL will be utilized to establish a robust database for storing essential information. The project aims to create a structured platform that enables users to search for products, view detailed descriptions, and make purchases with ease.
